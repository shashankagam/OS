Process Management

Note : 
1. Read Man pages of the functions/commands mentioned in the hint of each question. 
2. You will get the name of header file to be included for that function to work, in the man page of that respective function. 

Questions : 

1. Parent and child process 
Write a C/CPP program to create a child process. Child should print its pid and its parent’s pid and should exit by printing message as “Child Exiting …”. Parent should print its pid and should exit by printing message as “Parent Exiting ..”. 
(Hint(functions to be used) : getpid, fork, getppid) 

ANS:

#include <iostream> 
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
using namespace std; 
int main() { 
	pid_t pid; 
	cout << "Before fork!!!!!" << endl;
	pid = fork(); 
	if(pid==0) { 
		cout <<"this is child process:" << getpid() <<"  " << getppid() <<  endl; 
		execv("/bin/date", "date", NULL);
		cout << endl << "-----------------------------" << endl;		
		exit(0);
	exit(0); 

	} else if(pid>0) { 
		cout << "this is parent process:" << getpid()<< "  "  << getppid() << endl; 
		execl("/bin/date", "date", NULL);
		exit(0);
	}
	else { 
		cout << "process is not created" << endl; 
	} 
exit(0);
return 0;
} 




2. Scheduling functions 
Write a program in C/CPP to check the scheduling policy used by the process and its priority. 
	(Hint(functions to be used) : sched_getscheduler, getpid) 

ANS:

#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sched.h>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    pid_t pid;
    cout << "Before fork!!!!!" << endl;
    pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0)
    {
        // cout << pid << endl;
        cout << "This is child process. Process ID: " << getpid() << "  "
             << "Parent ID: " << getppid() << "  "
             << "Scheduling Policy Status: "
             << sched_getscheduler(pid) << endl;

        // execl("/bin/date", "date", NULL);
        cout << endl
             << "-----------------------------" << endl;
        exit(0);
    }
    else if (pid > 0)
    {
        //  cout << pid << endl;
        cout << "this is parent process:" << getpid() << "  "
             << "Parent ID: " << getppid() << "  "
             << "Scheduling Policy Status: "
             << sched_getscheduler(pid) << endl;
        // execl("/bin/date", "date", NULL);
        exit(0);
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "process is not created" << endl;
    }
    exit(0);
    return 0;
}





3. Scheduling functions 
Write a program in C/CPP to get the current scheduling policy of the process. The program should change 
the scheduling policy to the other than current one. 
Program should report errors if it fails to set the new scheduling policy. 
	(Hint(functions to be used) : sched_setscheduler, getpid) 


4. Scheduling algorithm 
Write a program in C/CPP to take process name, its arrival time and execution/burst time as input. 
	Use FCFS(non-preemptive) algorithm to calculate wait time of each process, average 
wait time, turnaround time of each process and average turnaround time. 
	Calculation of time will start from the arrival time of first process.
execution/burst time - Time required for execution of process
	Wait time of process = response time of process - arrival time process
	Response time of process : time at which process is scheduled to run
	Average wait time = (sum of wait time of each process) / (number of processes) 
	Turnaround time of process = (finish/completion time of process) - (arrival time of process)
	Average turnaround time = (sum of turnaround time of each process) / (number of processes) 

ANS:

#include <iostream>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

    //     this->bTime = bTime;
    // }
